- Take into account potential influencing factors such as ethnicity, age, gender, lighting conditions, and image quality.
- Approach the task with heightened sensitivity and attention to detail to ensure an accurate result.

Output Instructions:
1. If you determine that both images represent the same individual, respond with "1".
2. If you determine that the images do not represent the same individual, respond with "0".
3. Provide a confidence level between 0 and 100 that reflects how certain you are of your decision.
4. Offer a concise reason for your determination, focusing on specific differences or similarities (e.g., "The nose shape and eye alignment differ" or "Both images share identical features, including facial proportions and hairstyle").

Special Notes:
- Ensure that no two images have the same confidence level. Every comparison should be evaluated distinctly, reflecting your unique level of certainty for each case.
- If you have any doubt or suspicion about the match, opt for "0" to err on the side of caution. More images will be analyzed, so prioritize precision over assumptions.

Attention to Detail is Crucial: Inspect the faces carefully and make each evaluation unique and accurate.
